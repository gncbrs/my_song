[Verse 1]
Let us feel those feelings that we felt once before
Let me mend your heart that was once full
Let us fix the issues that we left outside the doors
Let us learn to heal rather than to ignore

[Bridge]
I wanna lift you up, I'm gonna set you down
I'm gonna take your hand and spin you round and round
I'm gonna open my arms and open my ears
I'm gonna listen to your stories, wipe away your tears

[Chorus]
I, I wanna lift you up, I'm gonna lift you up
I wanna lift you up, I'm gonna lift you up
Oh I, I wanna lift you up, I'm gonna lift you up
I wanna lift you up, I'm gonna lift you up
Oh I, I, I

[Verse 2]
We're gonna run through the streets and along the beach
We're gonna feel the cobblestones in the catted out feet
We're gonna run out in the snow, where no one else would go
We're gonna stand out in the rain and drown of all the pain

[Chorus]
I, I wanna lift you up, I'm gonna lift you up
I wanna lift you up, I'm gonna lift you up
Oh I, I wanna lift you up, I'm gonna lift you up
I wanna lift you up, I'm gonna lift you up
Oh I, I, I
